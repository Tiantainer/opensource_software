### Description

As a follow-up on the fixes @renan-r-santos submitted in https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/2217, there's a few more items to consider as the https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/main/.config-schema.json file still has a few invalid or missing properties:

1. `OPENFGA_HTTP_TLS_KEY` and `OPENFGA_GRPC_TLS_KEY`: should have type ""string"", currently doesn't have any
2. `OPENFGA_DATASTORE_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME` and `OPENFGA_DATASTORE_CONN_MAX_IDLE_TIME`: should have default value and the current section moved to the description field
3. `OPENFGA_AUTHN_PRESHARED_KEYS`, `OPENFGA_HTTP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `OPENFGA_HTTP_CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS` have no description
4. Boolean values are sometimes written as boolean strings, e.g. (`OPENFGA_CONTEXT_PROPAGATION_TO_DATASTORE` is `false` vs `OPENFGA_TRACE_ENABLED` is `""false""`)

### Description

Hi there,

recently, we faced an issue we are not able to fix. As usual, here is an example with simplified business rules to understand the problem:
* an entity belongs to a `parent` organization.
* an organization has `children` entities.
* entities can have a `subscription`.
* custom features can be enabled on entities.
* if an entity has custom features enabled and a subscription, then the parent organization also has access to the custom features.

Of course, these are not our current business rules, we simplified them, the point still is the same: if a child has access to something, we want to transmit it to its parent. Here is the model and tests we use for this example (keep in mind that types and relations are modelized that way because this is exactly what we want from a business point of view).

```yaml
---
name: tests

model: |
  model
    schema 1.2
  type user
  type entity
    relations
      define parent: [organization]
      define subscription: [entity]
      define custom_features: [entity]
      define has_custom_features_enabled: custom_features and subscription
      define has_organization_custom_features_enabled: parent from has_custom_features_enabled
  type organization
    relations
      define children: [file]
      define has_custom_features_enabled: has_organization_custom_features_enabled from children

tuples:
  - user: entity:a
    relation: children
    object: organization:a
  - user: organization:a
    relation: parent
    object: entity:a
tests:
  - name: Custom features enabled on an entity are also enabled on the parent organization
    description: Ensure custom features are transmitted to an entity parent organization when enabled
    tuples:
      - user: entity:a
        relation: enable_custom_features
        object: entity:a
    check:
      - user: organization:a
        object: organization:a
        assertions:
          has_custom_features_enabled: true
  - name: Custom features disabled on an entity are also disabled on the parent organization
    description: Ensure custom features are not transmitted to an entity parent organization when disabled
    check:
      - user: organization:a
        object: organization:a
        assertions:
          has_custom_features_enabled: false
```

As explained in the title, when running the command `fga model test --tests my-test-file.fga.yaml` using the CLI, we receive the following log error:

> Error: error running tests due to rpc error: code = Code(2056) desc = the 'entity#has_custom_features_enabled' relation is referenced in at least one tupleset and thus must be a direct relation

We don't understand why the `has_custom_features_enabled` relation on the `file` type is considered as a _tupleset_ one, we simply want to redirect to the entity itself if custom features are enabled. We discussed this _trick_ with @aaguiarz months ago and we are actively using it, it's perfectly working. The difference with this current example is that we move from a type to another, and this seems to break the model.

I saw issue openfga/openfga#2137 while searching for the error message but that is all I found. Please let me know why we can't have concentric relation pointing to concentric relation.

Cheers,

Geoffroy

### Description

When issuing a `Read` API Call, the [following](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#read-relationship-tuples) are the only supported patterns.

```js
// 1. Find if a relationship tuple stating that a certain user is a viewer of a certain document
const body = { tuple_key: {
  user: ""user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b"",
  relation: ""viewer"",
  object: ""document:0192ab2a-d83f-756d-9397-c5ed9f3cb69a"",
} };

// 2. Find all relationship tuples where a certain user has any relation to a certain document
const body = { tuple_key: {
  user: ""user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b"",
  object: ""document:0192ab2a-d83f-756d-9397-c5ed9f3cb69a"",
} };

// 3. Find all relationship tuples where a certain user is a viewer of any document
const body = { tuple_key: {
  user: ""user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b"",
  relation: ""viewer"",
  object: ""document:"",
} };

// 4. Find all relationship tuples where a certain user has any relation with any document
const body = { tuple_key: {
  user: ""user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b"",
  object: ""document:"",
} };

// 5. Find all relationship tuples where any user has any relation with a particular document
const body = { tuple_key: {
  object: ""document:0192ab2a-d83f-756d-9397-c5ed9f3cb69a"",
} };

// 6. Read all stored relationship tuples
const body = {};
```

Some folks are trying an unsupported query:
```js
// Find all relationship tuples where any user of a certain type has any relation with any object of a certain type
const body = { tuple_key: {
  user: ""user:"",
  object: ""document:"",
} };
```

In this case we are currently returning an empty array, because we're treating it like case (4) but not finding any user that matches `user:` (of course, as that is an invalid user).

What we should be doing to help folks is throw a 400 error so that they know that the query is wrong.

```
folder:1#viewer@group:1#allmembers
folder:1#viewer@group:2#allmembers
group:1#member@user:1

```

calling check(user:1, viewer: folder:1) with NO context for x will yield error when `enable-check-optimizations` is enabled while returning true when `enable-check-optimizations` is not enabled.

Similarly, for the above model and the following tuples
```

```
calling check(user:1, viewer: folder:1) with NO context for x will yield error when `enable-check-optimizations` is enabled while returning false when `enable-check-optimizations` is not enabled.

### Description

## Summary
After upgrading OpenFGA from version 1.3.0 to 1.5.4, requests to the /check endpoint fail with the error message: `""type <my_entity> not found""`. This issue occurs despite the entity type being defined and working correctly in version 1.3.0.

## Steps to Reproduce

- used the [docker compose file](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml)(updated it to have volumes for postgres mounted). updated file: [docker-compose.yml.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17835607/docker-compose.yml.txt) (remove `.txt` to use it, had to add it as github would not let me upload `.yml` files).
- initially use v1.3.0 of openfga i.e `image: openfga/openfga:v1.3.0` in the docker compose file
- `docker-compose up -d`
- add sample data: store.fga.yaml can look like [contract.fga.yaml.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17840004/contract.fga.yaml.txt)
- make `/read` and `/check` calls for the tuple and observe that there are no issues
- `docker-compose down`
- update the docker compose file to set the version to 1.5.4 i.e `image: openfga/openfga:v1.5.4`
- `docker-compose up -d`
- `/read` call is successful but `/check` throws an error with message `""type 'contract' not found""`

There seems to be an issue with migrate where the DB is not gracefully migrated so the entities are not recognized in newer version.

### Update

This issue appears to be less related to ECR and more related to the `docker pull` command and specifying architecture types.

### Description

Hello! Thank you for all the work on Open FGA.

Starting with version v1.5.5+ - I'm unable to use the docker images with AWS ECR and ECS. ECR reports the following when scanning the image for security vulnerabilities:

```
Image not supported
UnsupportedImageError: The operating system and/or package manager are not supported.
```

### How we vendor the image

The containers are run on standard Fargate x84_64/amd64 instances. We distribute the image in an ECR repository as-is, without any modifications or additional dependencies to the image. Here's how I do that on my machine:

```sh
# set the open fga version
export VERSION=v1.5.5

# log into ecr
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# pull the specific image
docker pull openfga/openfga:$VERSION

# tag the newly pulled image
docker tag openfga/openfga:$VERSION $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/vendored/openfga/openfga:$VERSION

# push the image to the ECR remote
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/vendored/openfga/openfga:$VERSION
```

When I update the task definition to use the new image, I get the following startup error, which typically signals the architectures are mismatching:

```
exec /openfga: exec format error
```

### Specs

* Apple M3 Pro
* Sonoma 14.3
* Docker version 27.3.1, build ce1223035a
* Docker desktop 4.34.3

### Debugging

My initial thought was that I need to specify `--platform linux/amd64` when pulling the image. Inspecting the images locally I can see they are all linux/amd64. 

The sha256 values match between the vendored ECR image and the docker hub images.

```sh
$ aws ecr describe-images --repository-name vendored/openfga/openfga --image-ids imageTag=v1.5.5

### Description

In the release notes for [OpenFGA v1.7.0](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.7.0), the maximum number of contextual tuples was increased from 20 to 100. However, this change doesn’t appear to be applied in the Docker image for v1.7.0.

When testing with a new container, calls to /stores/{storeId}/list-objects or /stores/{storeId}/check still result in a 400 Bad Request error, with the message: ""invalid ContextualTupleKeys.TupleKeys: value must contain no more than 20 item(s)"".

Also, is there any plans to let developers override this limit?

### Description

We have a usecase where we create a group and then list the groups in the UI with all the permissions assigned to the group.
When we run read tuples with the particular group or a particular object type on a large enough set of tuples, the api timeouts out with sql error 

Looking into the DB we saw the below sql statement run
```sql
SELECT store, object_type, object_id, relation, _user, condition_name, condition_context, ulid, inserted_at FROM tuple WHERE store = '01HY2AB17XACTGSZ8E2MPZ2W6B' AND object_type = 'organization' AND _user = 'group:99#member' ORDER BY ulid LIMIT 51
```
Running an explain on this sql statement, we get the following:
```md
# id	select_type	table	partitions	type	possible_keys	key	key_len	ref	rows	filtered	Extra
1	SIMPLE	tuple		index	PRIMARY,idx_reverse_lookup_user	idx_tuple_ulid	104		102	5.00	Using where
```
It uses the idx_tuple_ulid index instead of the PRIMARY or idx_reverse_lookup_user possibly because of the ORDER BY ULID statement.
The result takes about 65 seconds to complete on a table with 12044739 rows. 

Forcing the use of `PRIMARY` index results in a drastic reduction of query time to 3.5 seconds. 

Creating a purpose built index for this operation:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_tuple_list_permissions on tuple (store, object_type, _user);
```
Reduces the query time down to 0.2 seconds.

### Description

I don't know if this is a bug or a feature, but it looks strange and unexpected.

When getting tuples passing full user (type+id) and type only for the object it works:

```sh
λ  builder main ✓ fga tuple read --store-id=01J82JPK1AVKSJQJAK35DNWWNB --user user:ybwtv2146mir --object organization:
{
  ""continuation_token"":"""",
  ""tuples"": [
    {
      ""key"": {
        ""object"":""organization:b7851d2d-79a8-4c07-915d-286f1b308716"",
        ""relation"":""owner"",
        ""user"":""user:ybwtv2146mir""
      },
      ""timestamp"":""2024-09-18T14:37:15.560864Z""
    }
  ]
}
```

When doing the same the opposite way (type only for the user and full for the object) it doesn't:

```sh
λ  builder main ✓ fga tuple read --store-id=01J82JPK1AVKSJQJAK35DNWWNB --user user: --object organization:b7851d2d-79a8-4c07-915d-286f1b308716
{
  ""continuation_token"":"""",
  ""tuples"": []
}
```

Omitting the `user` field works fine:

```sh
λ  builder main ✓ fga tuple read --store-id=01J82JPK1AVKSJQJAK35DNWWNB --object organization:b7851d2d-79a8-4c07-915d-286f1b308716
{
  ""continuation_token"":"""",
  ""tuples"": [
    {
      ""key"": {
        ""object"":""organization:b7851d2d-79a8-4c07-915d-286f1b308716"",
        ""relation"":""owner"",
        ""user"":""user:ybwtv2146mir""
      },
      ""timestamp"":""2024-09-18T14:37:15.560864Z""
    }
  ]
}
λ  builder main ✓
```

If I'm not mistaken, this behavior is due to this part of the code:

https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/main/pkg/storage/postgres/postgres.go#L195-L197

which is different from how `object` is handled:

https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/main/pkg/storage/postgres/postgres.go#L185-L191

### Description

When restarting OpenFGA, our server experiencing forced connection close.
When OpenFGA receives SIGTERM signal it continue processing ongoing requests and shutdown only when nothing left.
SIGTERM should also added to handled signals at [code](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/v1.6.1/cmd/run/run.go#L438)

Kubernetes sends SIGTERM on graceful termination period. [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination)
> Typically, with this graceful termination of the pod, kubelet makes requests to the container runtime to attempt to stop the containers in the pod by first sending a TERM (aka. SIGTERM) signal, with a grace period timeout, to the main process in each container.

### Description

### Checklist

- [x]  I agree to the terms within the [OpenFGA Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openfga/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Describe the problem you'd like to have solved

While attempting to run the OpenFGA Playground on the Brave browser, I encountered a network error that prevented the application from functioning correctly. The error message observed in the console was:

```
POST http://127.0.0.1:9000/stores net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
AxiosError: Network Error
```
This issue appears to be related to Brave's built-in privacy features or browser extensions that block certain network requests, such as ad blockers or privacy tools.(not sure why though)

### Steps to Reproduce

    1. Open the Brave browser.
    2. Navigate to the OpenFGA Playground.
    3. Observe the network error in the console when trying to interact with the playground.

### Describe the ideal solution

Consider providing a warning or notification within the OpenFGA Playground that informs users about potential issues with Brave or similar browsers. This could help users troubleshoot the problem more effectively.

### Alternatives and current workarounds

Didn't dig into it too much, switched to Chrome and works fine there.

### Additional context

- ***Browser***: Brave
- ***Operating System***: Linux Mint 21.3
- ***OpenFGA Version***: 1.5.9

this doesn't panic, even though the `deadline`  is a negative number.

### Description

As part of our deployments we run a `migrate` every time before we start a `run` container. Now we discovered that, because we had to re-deploy the same version of openfga twice, the second time the migration errors.

`Error: failed to get db version: ERROR: relation ""goose_db_version"" already exists (SQLSTATE 42P07)`

We assume this might be unintended and something like a return `0` with a no migration necessary log should have happened.


### Expectation

When migration is already applied return code would be `0`

### Reproduction

1. Run migrate
2. Run migrate

### Description

It seems to me that `tuple.SplitObject(obj)` is incorrectly implemented.
1. it supports an input such as `group#member:fga`, which is invalid.
2. for a valid input `group:fga#member` it returns `group, fga#member `. It should be `group`, `member`, `fga`.

Luckily, when we pass a userset as input, we always discard the second return value, so this doesn't manifest in any bugs.

### Expectation

- `tuple.SplitObject` should accept correctly formatted usersets as inputs.
- If it's possible, I recommend changing the return types from `(typeAndRelation, id)` to `(type, relation, id)` and deprecate `SplitObjectRelation`. These two functions almost always are called together, which is a code smell.

## Description
The suspected cause of this issue: Currently, the test does not read the response body data for HTTP requests, and instead closes the body immediately after the client returns. This causes the client to close and discard the TCP connection immediately and move on. The `StreamedListObjects` sends response objects concurrently, and will attempt to send all objects, regardless of the state of the connection. This creates a race condition between the server sending all of the response objects before emitting the log, and the test attempting to read the logs. Hence the flakiness of this test.

To fix the issue, we will now read the entire streaming response body, to EOF, before attempting to read the logs. This will ensure that the test waits until the server has processed and sent all response objects and had a chance to emit the log that the test is expecting.

### Description

While executing 2-3 `Write` calls per second, we're observing a consistent low rate of `4000` internal server errors from OpenFGA. The logs indicate this is a SQL Deadlock: `""internal_error"":""sql error: ERROR: deadlock detected (SQLSTATE 40P01)""`. There are only 2 other processes writing to OpenFGA but they are competing to write the same tuples.

We're running on AWS RDS, using the official container image. 

Given the consistency of the error, I believe it is pathological in the sql_common implementation. I suspect adding a ""SELETE FOR UPDATE"" clause would resolve this deadlock, as the current implementation in-deterministically locks rows on update.

Technically this behavior isn't incorrect but requires the client to continue to retry (i.e. pessimistic). Rather, it'd be probably more ergonomic to block on the lock and execute afterwards.

### Expectation

Multiple writers can issue Write requests without erroring.

### Reproduction

1. openfga v1.5.4 running via docker
2. Run multiple writer go routines to create ""Write"" traffic at a rate of 2-3 RPS.
3. Observe 4000 error codes, SQL deadlock logs.

### Description

Imagine a river and we have a boat on this river, imagine that this river bifurcates towards the end of the road and splits into two. Assume that one of the paths has an obstacle and the other does not. When our boat on the river approaches this fork in the road, you would expect it to go to the road without obstacles instead of the one with obstacles, right? This is exactly what I'm trying to explain, in 'blocked' relationships, it always chooses the 'blocked' relationship in dual path situations. Whereas the other path is open and accessible from that path.


When I add the blocking relation below, members of the group:management continue to access the group even though I have blocked members of the group:management from accessing the group.

```
  - user: group:management#member
    relation: blocked
    object: group:management
```

### Expectation

- The admin user should have access to the management group's action named 'management'.
- The president user should not be able to access the management group's action named 'management' because the members of the management group are blocked from accessing the management group.

When I use usersets, I expect the userset block of that relationship to be blocked, but it is not blocking at the moment.
When the following tuple is added, my expectation from the system is that the 'access_member' relationship returns 'false' but currently it returns 'true'.

```
  - user: group:management#member
    relation: blocked
    object: group:management
```

### Description

We experienced an issue trying to upgrade OpenFGA from `v1.4.3` to `v1.5.4`. The migration runs (via docker) fine but any subsequent `Check` or `ListObject` calls returns a validation error (`type %s not found`). Notably, the `Expand` operation still recognizes the types, along with the Playground. 

```
$ fga query expand read doc:abcd
{
  ""tree"": {
   ... results
}

$ fga query check user:u read doc:abcd
Error: failed to check due to failed to check due to Check validation error for POST Check with body {""code"":""validation_error"",""message"":""type 'doc' not found""}
 with error code validation_error error message: type 'doc' not found
```

We're currently running on `v1.43` but have been running since `v1.12`. I noticed that the authorization model storage has changed and suspect that we have an older authorization model with explicit `type` columns and serialized `type_definition` columns. 

```
openfga=# select * from authorization_model where authorization_model_id='y';
-[ RECORD 1 ]----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
store                  | s
authorization_model_id | y
type                   |
type_definition        |
schema_version         | 1.1
serialized_protobuf    |  <protobuf serialized>

openfga=# select * from authorization_model where authorization_model_id='x';
-[ RECORD 1 ]----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
store                  | s
authorization_model_id | x
type                   | doc
type_definition        |  <protobuf serialized>
schema_version         | 1.1
serialized_protobuf    |
```

To fix this issue, I did the following:
1. Re-save the same model as a new model id ""y"" via `fga model write --file`
2. Update the model in postgres via: `update authorization_model set authorization_model_id='x' where authorization_model_id='y';`
3. Delete older format: `delete from authorization_model where authorization_model_id='x' and type != '';` 
4. Upgrade to v1.5.4

This resolved the issue and did not break traffic, as the model-id did not change.

I did a pass through the code and couldn't find a smoking gun, notably https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blame/main/pkg/storage/sqlcommon/sqlcommon.go#L502-L518 looks correct in that it always exits with the deserialized model iff one exists. The behavior when one doesn't exist seems sound.

This change does seem correlated with the breakage: https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/1387

### Expectation

I expected the older format schema to work with the newer request validation logic. This is a breaking change somewhere in >`v1.4.3`.

### Reproduction

1. Given a older row-per-type authorization_model stored in Postgres
2. Validation fails in Check/ListObject calls due to missing type information

### Description

According to OpenFGA API docs, if there are no changes after the provided continuation token, the same token will be returned in order for it to be used when new changes are recorded. If the store never had any tuples added or removed, this token will be empty.

However,  current behaviour is that if record is empty, it will not return any continuation token even if the continuation token is provided.  This is seen in [unit test](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/4b47d50594b9c7e436d64cf783c0aedba30b940f/pkg/storage/test/tuples.go#L175).

### Expectation

Same continuation token should be returned if  continuation token was provided in the request.

### Reproduction

### Description

Hi Team,
We spotted with our recommendation tool for PostgreSQL (pghero) that the Tuple table needs an index. We are a little bit surprised that we need to create it ourself. According to your documentation, it says that 'Bootstrapped and managed with the openfga migrate command. This will ensure the appropriate database indexes are created.' 
Thanks a lot!

### Expectation

No recommandations for indexes creation.

### Reproduction

We have OpenFGA 1.5.3 with Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL 14.10. We have 1 vcpu and 3,75 Gb RAM.
When we launch pghero on this database, it recommends us to create the following index:

### Description

Using k8s on the GCP platform, I'm trying to set up an API container with an OpenFGA container.
Before starting these containers, I initialize a first OpenFGA container (as k8s `initContainers`) to run the `migrate` command.

When I run `kubectl apply`, I get this error when the OpenFga migrate container tries to start:

`failed to create containerd task: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: ""migrate"": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown`

Container should deploy and start up correctly.

### Description

We are experiencing high latency and failing Check queries in production using the auth model below. The problem seems to stem from a particular set of users who have relations with multiple tenants and projects. When a check is performed with one of these users as the object, we are seeing dispatch counts in the hundreds and db query counts over a 100. 

This is causing queries to timeout and putting undue pressure on the db.

Is there anything we could do to make the model perform better while still maintaining the same intent of the model. For example we tried to substitute `owner_tenant` and `owner_project` with `[tenant#can_view_users, project#can_view_users]`, but this made the performance even worse. 

Another option I am aware of is decreasing the `OPENFGA_RESOLVE_NODE_BREADTH_LIMIT`, but I'm afraid that will lead to an unacceptable number of false negatives.

Any ideas would be appreciated?

### Expectation

I'd expect to be able check relations in a timely manner even for objects that have many relations.

### Reproduction

1. Use the model below.
2. Create a user[0] with many `owner_tenant` and `owner_project` relations
3. Create another user[1] with one shared tenant
4. Check `user[1] can_view user[0]`
5. Observe high dispatch and db query counts 

### Store data

```yaml
model
  schema 1.1

type project
  relations
    define admin: [user] or owner
    define can_view: viewer
    define can_view_users: viewer
    define editor: [user] or admin
    define member: [user] or viewer
    define owner: [user] or super_admin from owner_tenant
    define owner_tenant: [tenant]
    define revoked: [user] or revoked from owner_tenant
    define viewer: [user] or editor

type tenant
  relations
    define admin: [user] or super_admin
    define can_view: (member or external_member) but not revoked
    define can_view_users: member but not revoked
    define editor: [user] or admin
    define external_member: [user]
    define member: [user] or editor
    define revoked: [user]
    define super_admin: [user]

type user
  relations
    define can_edit: owner
    define can_list_memberships: owner
    define can_view: owner or can_view_users from owner_tenant or can_view_users from owner_project
    define owner: [user]
    define owner_project: [project]
    define owner_tenant: [tenant]

### Description

When carrying out openfga write operation for a tuple, I am getting this issue.  I am using docker to run the openfga service.

### Expectation

The write operation should have been successful. The write operations are successful most of the times because all the client configurations are correct. This issue is seen on interval i.e. in few days. It goes away on rerunning the container and this issue will reoccur after few days.

### Reproduction

I don't have any steps to reproduce...

### Store data

### Description

`tl;dr` - We should avoid returning an error in ListObjects for Conditional Relationship Tuple evaluation errors if we've already determined a determinate result for that object.

Given an FGA model such as:
```
type user

type org
  relations
    define viewer: [user]

type folder
  relations
    define viewer: [user]

type document
  relations
    define parent: [folder with condx, org with condy]
    define viewer: viewer from parent

condition condx(x: int) {
  x < 10
}

condition condy(y: int) {
  y > 25
}
```

- document:1#parent@folder:x, condition: condx
- document:1#parent@org:acme, condition: condy
- folder:x#viewer@user:jon
- org:acme#viewer@user:jon

`Check(document:1#viewer@user:jon, context: {""x"": 5})` will always return `{allowed: true}` through the branch of evaluation that involves `folder:x#viewer@user:jon`.

`ListObjects(document#viewer, user:jon, context: {""x"": 5})` will return an error (error code 2000). This is because we'll see the `document:1#parent@org:acme` relationship, but we won't be able to evaluate it because context parameter `y` is missing.

The OpenFGA server shouldn't return an error for the ListObjects case, because it is able to find `document:1` through the `folder:x#viewer` branch and so the other parent relationship with `org:acme` that is unresolvable should be irrelevant.

### Expectation

I expect the following:

`Check(document:1#viewer@user:jon, context: {""x"": 5})` --> `{allowed: true}` - through `folder:x#viewer`
`Check(document:1#viewer@user:jon, context: {""y"": 26})` --> `{allowed: true}` - through `org:acme#viewer`

`ListObjects(document#viewer, user:jon, context: {""x"": 5})` --> `[""document:1""]` - through `folder:x#viewer`
`ListObjects(document#viewer, user:jon, context: {""y"": 26})` --> `[""document:1""]` - through `org:acme#viewer`

### Reproduction

1. Write the authorization model

    }

```

3. Call ListObjects
```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/stores/01HSNVPXRVE6MGW080RPZ4C880/list-objects' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    ""type"": ""document"",
    ""relation"": ""viewer"",
    ""user"": ""user:jon"",
    ""context"": {
        ""x"": 5
    }
}'
```

I expect step #3 above to return `[""document:1""]` not an error. Similarly,

### Description

When trying to deploy OpenFGA with Postgres via Kubernetes we ran into a “userinfo” parsing error. We are providing the Job the credentials via external secrets as outlined in the helm template conditional. The final manifest produces the following URI (redacted to remove all production references): `”uri”: “postgres://postgres:<password-containing-unescaped-characters>@host:port/database”`. The password contains hyphens, curly brackets, and parenthesis; looking into url.parse() in Golang it looks like it is expecting escaped characters. 

```
case ""postgres"":
	driver = ""pgx""
	migrationsPath = assets.PostgresMigrationDir

	// Parse the database uri with url.Parse() and update username/password, if set via flags
	dbURI, err := url.Parse(uri)
```

### Expectation

I would expect this to sanitize the URI string on the backend and not expect the URI to be escaped. For instance, the following URI should be valid:

`postgres://postgres:JdnKsnd83$;):”-&:jaj]^]*}hs/ns\l@example.com:5432/postgres`

Due to the way `url.parse()` currently handles this, this string would fail due to unescaped non-alpha-numeric characters being present in the password.

### Reproduction

1. Configure OpenFGA in Kubernetes
1. Configure OpenFGA to use Postgres
1. Configure Postgres to use a URI
1. Configure the Postgres URI to contain unescaped non-alpha-numeric characters

<sup>Originally posted by **jakereps** April  2, 2024</sup>
Hi 👋 We're currently investigating some issues related to vulnerability scans, and it led me to discover that the docker container for openfga v1.5.1 does not match the source code in Github for v1.5.1. The Dockerfile on v1.5.1 specifies to use the grpc health probe v0.4.25 (fixed version, with no CVEs), but in reality the v1.5.1 openfga image still contains v0.4.24 (triggers CVE scanners).

**Expectation**: 

The v1.5.1 Dockerfile specifies v0.4.25, https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/v1.5.1/Dockerfile#L1

```

`vcs.revision=645566fc4b06a8d51552166a34717ce7090fddf7` is still v0.4.24 of the health probe, and what is included in v1.5.1 of openfga's Docker image: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agrpc-ecosystem%2Fgrpc-health-probe+645566fc4b06a8d51552166a34717ce7090fddf7&type=commits

This slightly worries me that there may even be code changes missing. What does the process for release -> docker image updates look like and should something like this be expected, or should they always mirror each other for each stable version cut?</div>",性能问题,前端,未指定,未指定,False,0.0

### Description

On `main` right now, with the following FGA model:
```
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type document
  relations
    define viewer: [user]
```

If I try to write this model with:
```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/stores/01HSNVPXRVE6MGW080RPZ4C880/authorization-models' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  ""schema_version"": ""1.1"",
  ""type_definitions"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""user"",
      ""relations"": {},
      ""metadata"": null
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""document"",
      ""relations"": {
        ""viewer"": {
          ""this"": {}
        }
      },
      ""metadata"": {
        ""relations"": {
          ""viewer"": {
            ""directly_related_user_types"": [
              {
                ""type"": ""user""
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```
I get the following error:
**status_code:** 400 (Bad Request)
```
{
    ""code"": ""relations_too_few_items"",
    ""message"": ""invalid TypeDefinition.Relations: value must contain at least 1 pair(s)""
}
```

I tested the same workflow above with the most recent release `v1.5.1` and the issue does not exist, so a regression has been introduced in `main` specifically.

### Expectation

I expected no error and the model to be written successfully (status_code: 200).

### Reproduction

```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/stores/01HSNVPXRVE6MGW080RPZ4C880/authorization-models' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  ""schema_version"": ""1.1"",
  ""type_definitions"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""user"",
      ""relations"": {},
      ""metadata"": null
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""document"",
      ""relations"": {
        ""viewer"": {
          ""this"": {}
        }
      },
      ""metadata"": {
        ""relations"": {
          ""viewer"": {
            ""directly_related_user_types"": [
              {
                ""type"": ""user""
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

returns **status_code:** 400 (Bad Request)
```
{
    ""code"": ""relations_too_few_items"",
    ""message"": ""invalid TypeDefinition.Relations: value must contain at least 1 pair(s)""

### Description

A valid model returns an error `error running tests due to rpc error: code = Code(2056) desc = the definition of relation 'can_purchase' in object type 'card' is invalid: no entrypoints defined`

The DSL seems to parse correctly (CLI transforms it and VS Code shows no validation errors), but the server still returns an error.

### Expectation

Tests run successfully on this model. 

### Reproduction

Run `> fga model test --tests stripe.fga.yaml` in console

It seems that writing tuples randomly fails with the `Authorization Model not found` message.

It always works.

- [X] I agree to the terms within the [OpenFGA Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openfga/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Describe the problem you'd like to have solved

If the strict mode isn't set, or if NO_ZERO_IN_DATE is set, ListStores and other APIs silently stop working (as in, they don't return data).

Two issues reported about this: 

- https://github.com/openfga/openfga/issues/1255
- https://github.com/openfga/openfga/issues/449


### Describe the ideal solution

Let's work on treating the zero value for `time.Time` as nullable/nil so that API responses such as the response for the [ListStores API](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Stores/ListStores) omits the `updated_at` or `deleted_at fields` if it is nil or the zero value.

This task includes writing tests (TODO where?)

### Description

When auth model ID is not specified, it requires 2 DB lookup instead of 1 to fetch the latest.

Split from https://github.com/openfga/openfga/issues/1289

### Expectation

1 DB lookup should be sufficient to fetch the latest model.

### Reproduction

Call Check API and not specified auth model ID, you will observe that two DB lookups are needed in typesystem resolver

### Description

When I try to save a valid model I get 

`""error"":""the definition of relation 'can_enable_logging' in object type 'entity' is invalid: no entrypoints defined""`

If I delete the `can_enable_logging` relation or if I remove the `but not` from the `has_access_to_logging` relation 


### Expectation

It should not return an error.



### Reproduction

1. Try to save the model  or run `fga model validate --file model.fga`
2. It returns
```
{
  ""is_valid"":false,
  ""error"":""the definition of relation 'can_enable_logging' in object type 'entity' is invalid: no entrypoints defined""

### Description

I am reopening this [old issue](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/issues/942), as it we are still suffering from bad performance with using `but not`. So much so that we have just removed it from our models.

Doing a single check went from requiring 1-3 db queries to 10+ and avg latency of ~10ms to ~80ms. Large listObjects calls went from ~100-200ms to timing out at around 3s.


### Expectation

I'd expect `but not` to be a viable thing to use when modelling with minimal performance hits.

### Reproduction

Create a model with `but not` exclusions, watch performance suffer.

### Store data

A simplified sample of our model
```
model
  schema 1.1

type project
  relations
    ...
    define can_edit: editor
    define can_view: viewer
    
    define editor: [user] but not revoked
    define viewer: ([user] or editor) but not revoked
    define revoked: [user] or revoked from owner_tenant
    
    define owner_tenant: [tenant]

### Description

PProf shows that there are goroutine leaks in ListObjects when the number of items > max items for list objects

### Expectation

No goroutine leaks

### Reproduction

1. Set profiler enabled by specifying `--profiler-enabled`.  It does not matter what the datastore is
2. Create new model 
```
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type group
  relations
    define member: [user]
```
3. Adding tuples `group:1#member@user:A` to `group:10000#member@user:A`
4. Call list objects with `group#member@user:A`
5. Inspect profiler http://localhost:3001/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 .  See that the number of goroutine increases per list object call.

### Store data

```yaml
model_file: |
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type group
  relations
    define member: [user]

tuples:
  - user: user:A
    relation: member
    object: group:1
...
  - user: user:A
    relation: member
    object: group:10000
tests: # remove this if not a bug in Check or ListObjects API
  - name: test-1
    list_objects:
      - user: user:A
        type: group
        relation: member
```

### Description

We should forbid two or more conditions in a model from sharing the same parameter name.

### Expectation

We should forbid conditions that share the same parameter names. I.e. update this code https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/ee1cdd605b7d975ba3331889f14065b27c9cc1aa/pkg/typesystem/typesystem.go#L1127

### Reproduction

If two conditions share the same parameter name and type, issuing a Check or ListObjects call with `context {x = 1}` (for example) will be ambiguous, since `x` can have different meaning for each condition. E.g.

```yaml
model_file: |
  model
    schema 1.1
  type user
  type document
    relations
      define viewer: [user with cond1, user with cond2]

condition cond1(x: string) {
  x == ""19/2/2024"" // here ""x"" means a date
}
condition cond2(x: string) {
   x == ""maria"" // here ""x"" means a name
}
```

If two conditions share the same parameter name but with different types, you get type cast errors when calling Check or ListObjects

```yaml
model_file: |
  model
    schema 1.1
  type user
  type document
    relations
      define viewer: [user with cond1, user with cond2]

condition cond1(x: int) {
  x > 100
}
condition cond2(x: string) {
   x == ""hello""
}
```

For example if you call Check with `context: ""hello""`, you can get
```
{
   ""code"": ""validation_error"",
   ""message"": ""1 error occurred:\n\t* failed to evaluate relationship condition: parameter type error on condition 'cond1' - failed to convert context parameter 'x': expected type value 'int64', but found 'string'""
}
```

or if you call Check with `context: 1`, you can get

```
{
   ""code"": ""validation_error"",
   ""message"": ""1 error occurred:\n\t* failed to evaluate relationship condition: parameter type error on condition 'cond' - failed to convert context parameter 'x': expected type value 'string', but found 'int64'""

### Description

ListObjects returns error even if there are `max_results` available and it encountered an error evaluating a tuple's condition.

### Expectation

For regular ListObjects API, if there are `max_results` objects available to be returned, they should be returned, even if evaluating `object[max_results+1]` resulted in an error

For streaming ListObjects API, expected behavior is not clear. Should it return all the objects it found and then the error?

### Reproduction

1. Run server with `./openfga run --listObjects-max-results 1`
2. Create a store
```
curl --location 'localhost:8080/stores' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{""name"":""issue-1283""}'
```
3. Write model
```

4. Write Tuples
```

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \

                ""object"": ""folder:x"",
                ""relation"": ""viewer"",
                ""user"": ""user:jon""
            },
            {
                ""object"": ""document:1"",
                ""relation"": ""parent"",
                ""user"": ""folder:x""
            },
            {
                ""object"": ""document:2"",
                ""relation"": ""viewer"",
                ""user"": ""user:jon"",
                ""condition"": {
                    ""name"": ""condX""
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}'
```

5. Call ListObjects

```
curl --location 'localhost:8080/stores/01HR7V0DFGHMEVJD232SMN0MK1/list-objects' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--data '{
    ""type"": ""document"",
    ""relation"": ""viewer"",
    ""user"": ""user:jon""
}'
```

Every now and then you will get the correct answer: `{    ""objects"": [  ""document:1""   ] }`

However, most of the times you will get an error:

```

1275,Error when trying to save the directly pasted authorization models using openfga playground,closed,2023-12-28 07:42:29,2024-03-16 00:58:46,ruppo-912116,"['bug', 'Stale']",7,"**Summary**
I ran the docker compose for openfga locally and was fiddling around on the playground. On pasting the authorization model and saving it says `Something went wrong! Error saving types, try again later:` and thus it cannot be saved. I am only able to save if I edit the already successfully saved authorization model but cannot save on clearing everything and pasting directly.

- Steps to reproduce
- Navigate to the playground
- remove the current authorization model and paste a simple authorization model and try saving

My docker compose file:

```docker

I have this model:
```fga

    define can_view: [user]

type transition
  relations
    define start: [state]
    define end: [state]
    define can_apply: [user] and can_view from start and can_view from end

Attempting to write it results in the error
```json
{
  ""code"":""invalid_authorization_model"",
  ""message"":""the definition of relation 'can_transition_with' in object type 'state' is invalid: no entrypoints defined""

If I change `can_apply` to
```fga
define can_apply: [user] and can_view from start
```
it works fine.

I'm attempting to deploy openfga to production using the mysql datastore. I've been able to migrate the openfga tables, create store and authorization models. The problem is that I'm unable to list any stores. It's something I need within my code to find existing stores that I can attach to.

I can:

* Create Stores
* Create Authorization Models

I can't:
* List stores
* List authorization models

Once I run certain commands, I'm unable to use any list command on production mysql server. 

When I use docker-compose, I am able to list the stores within my database, and list the authorization models.

How do I debug the problem?

Describe the bug here.

- Steps to reproduce

Write a tuple, sleep, and write another tuple.

```
Write(document:1#viewer@user:jon)
time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
Write(document:2#viewer@user:bob)
```

- What did you expect to happen?

ReadChanges should return a changelog with two items, and the second item should have a timestamp that is about 10ms later than the first.

- What actually happened?
The second changelog item had a timestamp with the same second resolution/precision as the first.

Testing pagination on the changes endpoint I chose a page size of 2, some of the subsequent requests would have duplicate values from the previous request

- Steps to reproduce
  - Using the Python openfga_sdk
  - Using a page size of 2
  - Using 5 tuples (see below)
  - calling the change endpoint 3 times in succession each using the previous requests continuation token
  - The second request has a duplicate tuple
  - This results in 6 tuples in total with one duplicate
  
- What did you expect to happen?

That each request using the previous request continuation token would have newer distinct tuples

- What actually happened?

Some subsequent request using the previous requests continuation token would include the duplicate values

   -  Use the model and tuples provided from the Store data section below.
   - Run those three checks in order.

We've been experimenting with OpenFGA at Cochlear and we'd like to appreciate the amazing work you've been doing. It's awesome to see this how this project's evolving.

On a more codebase related question: How are you ensuring you return all data when `OPENFGA_LIST_OBJECTS_MAX_RESULTS` is set to `0`?

I couldn't find any test case that validates that flow.

Also, that setting doesn't seem to work for me. I'm happy to help and contribute with a fix if that's the case.

Thank you!

Note that the internal error is an occasional and there are list object requests that does not have 500 Internal Error.  In addition, for the above model, only list objects request for `viewer_not_restricted` exhibits this issue and other list objects such as `viewer` returns successfully.

690,Writing Authorization Models to a non-existent store returns 201,open,2023-04-12 22:34:10,,aaguiarz,['bug'],2,"When you call POST to `/stores/{store_id}/authorization-models` with a non-existent store_id you get back a 201 and a new model_id.  

We should return an error.

The way to do this is by introducing a foreign key where StoreID is used.

This includes:
- [ ] Creating a migration script that would create stores if they do not already exist for the distinct store_ids in the authorization models table, with a the store name being an empty string. An N+1 would be if we set the created_at and updated_at to the earliest relevant entry in the authorization model table.
- [ ] Create a migration script that would make all the store_ids across all the tables foreign keys pointing to the Stores table
- [ ] Catch the DB errors to expose our own errors
- [ ] Tests to ensure that the writes are not succeeding

The main reason to do this via a Foreign Key constraint in the DB vs extra DB call on each API call to ensure the existence of the store is b/c the latter has a much more drastic  adverse affect on latency, and it is something we can get for free (or as close to it as we can get while still satisfying the constraint) by using the DB.

It looks like the [streamserver interceptor](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/validator#StreamServerInterceptor) does not guarantee that the validation will happen before the mux tries to read the header.  It only guarantees that it will happen before reaching userspace handler.

The error that is reported is ver vague, `context deadline exceeded`. When you enable GRPC debug logging you can see the `tls: bad certificate` failure.

Most of the time, `grpc.addr` will be `0.0.0.0:<port>`, which essentially means currently the TLS cert must have `0.0.0.0` added as an IP SAN for TLS to be enabled along with HTTP.

The HTTP server needs to allow disabling host verification or, probably preferably, an `http.upstreamServerName` configuration options needs to be added and used as the server name when making the upstream connection.",崩溃,前端,未指定,未指定,False,495.0

557,[v0.3.6] ListObjects endpoint not working correctly after new version.,closed,2023-02-18 12:22:59,2023-02-23 11:02:05,xXAvoraXx,['bug'],6,"Hello, I've described the problem here https://github.com/orgs/openfga/discussions/113#discussioncomment-5017936 before, I'm moving this issue to a topic.

In v0.3.4 before the update, the ListObjects endpoint was returning a list as expected, but with the new update (v0.3.6) the ListObjects endpoint is returning empty. Below are all scenarios and requirements.

The scenario of the diagram above is:

plan-> feature -> permission
plan -> feature -> page
plan -> feature -> page -> component

businesses subscribe to a plan_group type.
`plan_group:businessId/planId`

Each resource_access_groub has a business parent.
`resource_access_group:businessId`

Each resource_access_group is associated with a permission_access.
`permission_access:businessId/permissionName`
`resource_access_group:businessId`

Each permission_access type is associated with a permission type.
`permission_access:businessId/permissionName`

The access of the permission_access type is restricted according to some scenarios with;

- `business_member`: The person who wants to access the permission type in the context context must be a business member.

- `can_member_access`: Must be a member of the business and have access to the feature type of the business.

- `can_owner_access`: It must be the owner of the business and have access to the feature type of the business.

- `business_role_member`: Must be both a business member and have a role.

- `can_access_individual_or_role`: It must be able to access the role or directly.

- `can_access_member_and_individual_or_role`: Must be both a member of the business and have access to the feature type of the business, and must be able to access or directly access the Role.

- `can_access`: Must be both a business member and able to access the business's feature type and be able to access or directly access the Role, or Both should be a business owner and have access to the business's feature type.


The purpose is;

We offer plans to our businesses that are associated with a feature. Properties are related to permissions. Permissions keep our endpoints, for example;
`permission:UserService.GetUser`

Every business has its own user pool. Businesses can reduce and increase the authorizations of their users. I'm using the permission_access type for this. But businesses' access to permissions for plans must be managed by system administrators. The point that provides this is permission and feature.

Businesses can assign or reduce permissions to their users based on the plans they have. Businesses can both authorize individually and authorize by role.

A user can be a user in more than one business.

The business owner can access directly if the user has the owner relationship with the business type.

75 permissions are registered in permission_repo.

If the business has the highest plan: 75 permission_accesses are registered for the business.

Every registered permission_access type is registered in resource_access_group. 75 more relationships are registered.

For permissions if the owner defines their user individual access rather than role. 75 permission_accesses are registered with the [user] relationship for the user it defines.

Roughly, a business has about 255 to 350 relationship tuples. This number will increase as business users are added.

`docker compose up`

Write the following authorization model:
```
model
  schema 1.0

type document
  relations
    define viewer as self
```

Write the following tuples:
`document:1#viewer@jon`

Call `ListObjects(document#viewer, jon)`

Notice you get an empty result set instead of an error:
```
{
    ""objects"": []
}
```

We need to change the behavior implemented here https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/main/pkg/server/commands/list_objects.go#L330-L333 to return an error promptly in the event that `ResolveCheck` fails. Ignoring an error and trying to complete the request despite the error is not in the best interest of consistency, because at best it leads to potential false reports. If you have access to an object and that object's Check fails, then you'll get an empty object list back, and that's not correct.

OpenFGA, as a system, should prioritize correctness over the attempt to fulfill the request at any cost.

380,Postgres connections are created and closed for each request,closed,2022-12-06 20:16:45,2023-03-27 17:57:17,OysteinVesth,"['bug', 'waiting-for-feedback']",20,"## Bug/issue

After upgrading from `v0.2.2` to `v0.2.3` we've noticed some weird behaver, an increased amount of calls against OpenFGA have become slow (over 800ms, our client times out after that).

The postgres logs in our AWS Aurora instance shows that OpenFGA is creating and closing connections _very_ often, looks like it connects and disconnects on every request.

We first saw this problem when we went from `v0.2.1` to `v0.2.5`, but after some testing it looks like the change happened in version `v0.2.3`, might be related to the pgx upgrade.

I suspect that the decrease in performance comes from creating the connection/authenticating each time. Is there an issue with connection pooling?

### Logs and connection URI

The postgres disconnection logs for `v0.2.2` looks like this:
```sh
LOG:  disconnection: session time: 1:13:33.121 user=postgres database=openfga host=10.1.1.252 port=43411
```

After deploying `v0.2.3` we get a bunch of these in the postgres logs, with connections closing in milliseconds (often one digit ms): 
```sh
LOG:  disconnection: session time: 0:00:00.110 user=postgres database=openfga host=10.1.1.22 port=28235
```

We've made no other changes than the upgrade, and when I revert back to `v0.2.2` the issue is gone.

We use a plain postgres URI without any params/options: 
```sh
postgres://XXX:XXX@XXX.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/openfga
```

Just let me know if you need any more details. We are currently running OpenFGA in production, so hoping this will be fixed - or that we can change this through config.",性能问题,数据库,未指定,未指定,False,110.0

Our tested model is as follows:

```py

    define editor as self or admin
    define member as self or viewer
    define viewer as self or editor

    define editor as self or owner or editor from parent
    define viewer as self or editor or viewer from parent
    define parent as self
```

Server setup as the documentation shows for postgres engine:

```sh
docker network create openfga
docker run -d --name postgres --network=openfga -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres:14
docker run --rm --network=openfga openfga/openfga migrate --datastore-engine postgres --datastore-uri 'postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable'
docker run --name openfga --network=openfga -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 openfga/openfga run --datastore-engine postgres --datastore-uri 'postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable' --listObjects-max-results 50000  --listObjects-deadline 360s
```

First we added a user as admin of an organization ORG1: `{""user"": ""user_1"",""relation"": ""admin"",""object"": ""organization:ORG1""}`

We then performed 600 iterations of adding 25 tuples: `{""user"": ""type_1: UUID_1"",""relation"": ""parent"",""object"": ""type_2:UUID_n""}`
and 1 tuple giving members of ORG1 ""editor"" relation to each type_1 element: `{""user"": ""organization:ORG1#member"", ""relation"": ""editor"", ""object"": ""type_1:UUID_1""}`.

This created 600 type_1 elements and 15000 type_2 elements where each type_1 element is parent of 25 type_2 elements

When we tried listing the objects of type_2 that some user has by using the list_objects endpoint with `{""type"": type_2,""relation"": ""editor"",""user"": ""user_1""}` we get the 15000 ids but if we try listing with a ""viewer"" relation rather than ""editor"" `{""type"": type_2,""relation"": ""viewer"",""user"": ""user_1""}` we get a 500 response.
